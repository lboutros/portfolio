      <h1 class="projectheadsandsubheads">Creating a centralized platform for data collection and collaboration to improve humanitarian assistance and disaster relief</h1>
  <div class="project-description">In the event of a natural disaster, even with emergency evacuation warnings coming well in advance, it is all too common for people to be trapped in the impacted disaster zone. Quickly assessing the disaster area and determining the type of response and team needed can be difficult.  
  <br><br>
  In times like these, the need for an effective and innovative approach to decrease response time and increase response accuracy is greater than ever.
  <br> <br>A solution is needed that provides disaster response teams with the most accurate, up-to-date, real time data and a centralized mechanism to identify and prioritize response needs in order to effectively coordinate and track a strategic response mission.

  <h1 class="projectheadsandsubheads"><i>Assess, identify, and deploy:<br></i> introducing ATLAS A.I.D.</h1>
  <div class="project-description">We built a map that turns overwhelming database tables into tailored, digestible, real-time data-visualizations ranging in level of detail from generalized clusters to individual pins, all of which appear in real time as their information is recorded and processed. <br><br>
  On the right is a navigation menu that filters through different data types in order to control visual clutter and display only the most relevant information necessary at the discretion of the user. Filters can be toggled through and displayed in parallel. <br><br>
  Atlas also features a chatbox, which promotes cross-collaboration between and within response teams that may not otherwise overlap, such as EMTs, firefighters, and military personnel. In this case, an order comes in for a flooding shelter area. <br><br>
  Response teams can share directions to locations, which are sourced from real-time road conditions and traffic updates. <br><br>
  In the event of an incident interfering with route efficiency, responders can click on the corresponding pin and check out its coordinates, crowdsourced media, confidence levels and data sources. These all go towards illustrating and contextualizing the situation in a way that raw data, as previously used, cannot do. Responders can click "resolve" to remove the pin from the map, archive its information, and reveal an updated, <i>more efficient</i> route.
